# MafiaGame List Generator

This is a project made in 2017 when I learned the basics of [Unity][unity link] using C#. That time I discovered this party game called [_Mafia_][Mafia game] (or _Werewolf_) where each player is assigned a role (_Citizen_, _Mafia_, _Doctor_, _Cop_, _1 Storyteller_ etc.) by picking a piece of paper or a playing card from a deck. There were times when we wasted lots of paper for this game so this app idea came to me.

The app is simple to use:
- _the storyteller_ sets the amount of players, number of desired _Mafia_ players, _doctors_ and _cops_;
- each player is assigned a number;
- the list is generated, and now it is ready to be seen anytime by the storyteller;
- the storyteller shows to each player its secret role by entering the corresponding number in the app.

A demo video can be found [here][video] and some screenshots down below.
